# DevOps Infrastructure Ontology Network

The DevOps infrastructure ontology network describes the domain of DevOps infrastructure. It is published at http://w3id.org/devops-infra

# Purpose and scope of the ontology network

This ontology network aims at representing the main sets of entities and relationships used in the context of DevOps infrastructure. 

It is the result of a collaboration between Huawei Research Ireland and the Ontology Engineering Group at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid. It originally started from an analysis of the Configuration Management Databases used by Huawei Research Ireland for the management of a large part of its DevOps infrastructure, and has evolved into an ontology that may be used as a starting point for the standardisation of the representation of CMDB-related data across vendors.
